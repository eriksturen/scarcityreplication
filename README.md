# scarcityreplication

This repository is created to hold files for a replication of study four in "Poverty impedes cognitive function" by Mani et al 2013. Here you will find mainly data from our collection on Prolific.co and a markdown file (Markdown mani et al replication) which contains our full replication paper with data wrangling, analysis etc. 

This project also has a connected OSF-page where data collection materials such as the priming materials from the original study (which we also used) and our full Qualtrics survey can be found. Link here: https://osf.io/gbhme/

Note that this repository was created mainly as a part of a university course in using github and markdown. We are still learning. If anything seems unclear or is obviously wrong, please let us know. The whole point of keeping our process open is that someone might spot errors that we have missed.
