Solution

The first piece is the only correct one.

The rule which defines the puzzle is: The dashed lines in the diagonal always form an X, i.e. the missing piece needs to have a dashed X. The second rule is that the position of the black rectangle systematically varies: It moves clockwise in each column and row, i.e. it has to be situated in the center of the lower part in the missing piece.

The sixth piece is the only correct solution.

This question presumes that I'm working a regular job -- which I'm not, as I'm an IC, as I've detailed already -- but if I were, that'd be the best way to do it, probably.","1) Borrow money from friend who's recently come into a six-figure inheritance (can pay back over long time, without worrying about interest)
2) Selling second car (which has probable cash value of $1,000US) and taking on additional freelance projects to make up the remainder 
3) Take a regular day job, as I'm a freelancer (and live totally on that income), and slot in freelance/side gigs as needed, until the amount is raised

The last option would require the greatest sacrifice, as I'm a caretaker for my wife, who has overlapping medical conditions (mostly immune system-related), and needs significant care and attention at home.
